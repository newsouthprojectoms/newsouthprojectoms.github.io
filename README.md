John B. Gordon was a member of the Bourbon Trimvirate, he was born on February 6, 1832 and died on January 9th, 1904. John B. Gordon was the General of the Confederate States Army, during the American Civil War. He was a slave owner, attorney, and a planter.


# WHAT WERE THEIR GOALS?


**GOAL NUMBER 1** 
The members of the Bourbon Trimvirate, Brown, Colquitt, and Gordon wanted to make Georgia's former large and main working class, Agriculture, with a new middle and business class.

**GOAL NUMBER 2**
They wanted Georgia's economy to instead of focusing on agricultural methods, to manufacture, and produce their own goods self-efficently.

# Unfortunately...

Georgia hardly had any money to make these changes.


# A quick solution...

After the men had realized this, they had still not gave up in their goals and were determined in reaching their goals. They then turned to investors, but instead investors in the South, they instead looked for investors in the North, since after Reconstruction and the Civil War had completely crushed the South's economy.

# A rise in power, economic power.

Their solution turned out to completely change their goals, as then they started to gain political and economic power over Georgia from 1872 to 1890, with either one of the men serving in the government as a governor or a U.S. Senator.

# The downfall

The Bourbon Trimvirate started to lose power in 1890, for various reasons. 

**REASON 1**

All three men were former seccesionists, and still supported members of the Antebellum planter class.

**REASON 2**

They had established lower taxes, and resulted in little or no service in government jobs to Georgia citizens, which at that time were in economic hardship.

**REASON 3**

Each one of the men were white supremacists.

# So, Did they reach their goals?

The Bourbon Triumivirate members did reach their goals, and significantly changed Georgia's economy, social structure, and the politics.

# Now, lets move onto a different topic.

Tom Watson was a American politician, attorney, newspaper writer, and a newspaper editor from Georgia. He was born on September 5th, 1856 and died on September 26th, of 1922.

## Before we move on to the Populist Party, Lets envolve the backstory.

Lets say Georgia was now growing economically, as businesses and banks began to succeed in the economy, But farmers, instead of gaining money, they began to face obstacles in the economy. Labor was also rare to find, after the Civil War.

# Now how does this envolve Tom Watson, you might ask?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e79f9820-6e12-4230-a0d6-9798750089c0)

Tom Watson was involved in the leadership of the Farmer's Alliance, which was made in March 21st of 1877, to the Populist Party. The Farmer's Alliance was made by a few farmers for forming cooperatives to improve the economic state of farmers in the 1870s.

In 1891, though Tom Watson was not involved in the creation of the Populist Party, he was one of the leaders of the political party. The People's Party, Or mainly known as the Populist Party, represented the "common man" and the farmers of the South. Their beliefs were the interest protection of farmers, and then urged them to work together for their cause. They also encouraged black and white equality, lower state taxes for farmers, more government control of railroads, labor laws that would limit the workday hours to eight hours, and better roads.


# Success or failure?

The Populist Party made a major change on Georgia by regulating railroads and banks to avoid any misuse of farmers, A graduated income tax, and fair elections for US Senators.

# Moving on...

Still, he was still considered black and still was arrested by the local authorities. Plessy was found guilty by Supreme Court. Plessy then appealed to the Supreme Court, and Supreme Court ruled against Plessy, and according to them they only protected civil and political rights, instead of social rights.

## The outcome?

The U.S. Supreme Court ended this case by saying that segregation was constitutional aslong if the segregated facilites were still the same as the other non-segregated facilities.

# DISENFRANCHISEMENT

Although the 15th Amendment protected black americans right to vote, Southerners still found this unacceptable and created ways to keep black americans from voting.

Poll Taxes

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fbd5b99-cb57-4832-b779-60c2b563768d)

All voters had to pay a 1 dollar tax in order to proceed to the voting process. Many Black Americans in this era were very poor and were unable to pay the tax.
